/**
 * Transaction coordinator for the WhatsApp webhook flow.
 *
 * Converts a ResolvedPayment (addresses + amounts) into a single
 * on-chain TxPayload that can be signed by the user's Privy wallet.
 *
 * Single recipient  → SendrPay.pay(to, amount)
 * Multi-recipient   → Not supported in a single tx without a batch contract.
 *                     The user receives a clear error message so they can
 *                     split the payment or use on-chain group functionality.
